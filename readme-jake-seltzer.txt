How long after taking attendance does the district need attendence reports?

It seems like it needs to be recorded automatically each period so the location of the students
can be tracked, like to make sure the middle school students don't go MIA after lunch.

Does the student database record absences?

This is a good question: do we already have information to work with, or is this a novel system?

Does the database need to be updated every period or every day or every week? etc..?

This is similar to the first question, it seems as though it needs to be updated multiple times a day to 
keep track of what a student is doing.

Are the teacher's computers powerful enough to run this attendance system? If not, should this system be ran on a seperate server?

It seems like they are not, as the server struggles to handle 170 users. We may need to create a separate server.
